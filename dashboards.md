# Dashboards

Each [sub-layout](untitled.md#root-layout) has its own Dashboard page and these can be found under `app/dashboard`.  The `dashboard.module.ts`exposes the [widget components](widgets.md) that are shared between dashboard pages. As a result any widget can be added to a dashboard just by including the particular selector.
