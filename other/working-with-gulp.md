Run the following commands

* Install `gulp` globally by running the following command `npm install -g gulp`
* In you downloaded package from themeforest, navigate to `gulp/` directory and copy both `package.json` `gulpfile.js` to your project root. e.g : `getting_started` folder
* Navigate to the root directory of your project or getting\_started folder, then run `npm install`.

Once you have successfully setup now you can use pages Gulp CLI commands to automate your task

## **Commands**

**gulp build**

This will automatically minify your assets resources like css and js into a folder called `dist`

**gulp watch**
